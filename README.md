# HTML Entity Encoder
This Python script allows users to input a string and convert it into HTML entity encoding. HTML entity encoding is used to represent special characters in HTML, ensuring they are safely rendered by browsers without being executed as code.

## USAGE
1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sasquatchchicken/htmlEntityEncoder.git
    cd htmlEntityEncoder


2. **Run the Script:**
   
   ```bash
    python htmlEntityEncoder.py
   
3. **Input a String:**
   
When prompted, enter the string you want to HTML entity encode.

### Example:

### If you input:

      <script>alert(1)</script>


 ### The script will output:

      &#60;script&#62;alert&#40;1&#41;&#60;/script&#62;

While an HTML entity encoder script is primarily a defensive tool used to prevent XSS and other injection attacks, a malicious threat actor could potentially misuse it in several ways. Hereâ€™s how an attacker could exploit such a tool, along with the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) they might employ:

### Potential Malicious Uses
1. **Obfuscation of Malicious Code:**

#### Tactic: Evasion

Technique: The attacker can use HTML entity encoding to obfuscate malicious payloads, making it harder for automated security tools and analysts to detect and analyze the malicious content.

Procedure: Encode a malicious script or payload to bypass simple pattern-matching defenses in web applications or security tools.

2. **Phishing Attacks:**

#### Tactic: Initial Access

Technique: An attacker could use the HTML entity encoder to craft phishing emails or web pages that look legitimate but contain encoded malicious links or scripts.

Procedure: Encode links or scripts to evade detection by email security gateways or web filters, increasing the likelihood of successful phishing.

3. **Bypassing Web Application Firewalls (WAF):**

#### Tactic: Defense Evasion

Technique: The attacker can use the encoded payload to bypass WAF rules that do not decode HTML entities.

Procedure: Encode attack payloads so that they pass through WAFs that do not properly decode and inspect entity-encoded inputs.

4. **Code Injection in Web Applications:**

#### Tactic: Execution

Technique: An attacker might use the encoder to inject encoded payloads into web applications that fail to properly decode and sanitize inputs.

Procedure: Use encoded payloads to exploit vulnerabilities in web applications that mishandle HTML entities.

## Example Scenarios
### Encoded Phishing URL:

The attacker creates a phishing email with a link:
      
      <a href="&#104;&#116;&#116;&#112;&#115;&#58;&#47;&#47;&#109;&#97;&#108;&#105;&#99;&#105;&#111;&#117;&#115;&#46;&#115;&#105;&#116;&#101;">Click here</a>

***The URL points to a malicious site but is encoded to evade detection.***

### Encoded XSS Payload:

An attacker submits a form with an encoded XSS payload:
    
      &#60;script&#62;alert&#40;'XSS'&#41;&#60;&#47;script&#62;

***If the application decodes and executes it, the XSS attack succeeds.***

### Bypassing WAF with Encoded SQL Injection:

The attacker encodes an SQL injection payload to bypass WAF rules:

      SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '&#97;&#100;&#109;&#105;&#110;' -- '

## Mitigation Strategies
To mitigate the risk of such misuse, organizations should:

1. ## Implement Robust Input Validation:

Ensure all user inputs are properly validated and sanitized, decoding entities before validation.

2. ## Use Advanced Security Tools:

Deploy security tools that can detect and decode HTML entities, ensuring encoded payloads are inspected.

3. ## Educate and Train Security Teams:

Train security analysts to recognize and decode HTML entities during manual reviews and investigations.

4. ## Regular Security Audits:

Conduct regular security audits and penetration tests to identify and remediate vulnerabilities that could be exploited with encoded payloads.

***By understanding both the defensive and potential offensive uses of an HTML entity encoder, security professionals can better protect their systems and anticipate how attackers might try to bypass their defenses.***
